## Building & Compiling Instructions

To build and compile the source code:

1. Acquire the `app_config.dart` file from the repo owner.
2. Place said file under `lib/utils/` folder.
3. `flutter run`
4. Done!

*p/s:* The league shown in-app can be changed to another, by updating the `app_config.dart` file's `competitionCode` and `competitionName` -- for example `'PL'` and `'Premier League'` respectively.
